# Ramsey Numbers

This repository contains several unpublished Ramsey graphs discovered in 2016.
The method used to establish the new lower bound for the Ramsey number R(12,12) is described in
"[On the Ramsey Number R(12,12)](https://mtatar.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/r12/)".
The other graphs are constructed using the techniques similar to those described in the article
"[New Lower Bounds for 28 Classical Ramsey Numbers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02403.pdf)".

|Ramsey number|Old Bound|New Bound|
|---|---|---|
|R(7,8)|217|[219](graphs/g78.218)|
|R(6,11)|256|[262](graphs/g611.261)|
|R(4,15)|155|[158](graphs/g415.157)|
|R(4,16)|166|[170](graphs/g416.169)|
|R(12,12)|1639|[1640](graphs/g1212.1639)|

All constructions are available [here](graphs).
